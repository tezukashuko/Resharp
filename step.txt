Clean the cuticle nippers: Before you begin sharpening your cuticle nippers, it's important to clean them thoroughly. Use a soft cloth and rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt, oil, or debris.

Determine the angle: The angle of the cuticle nipper blades is usually around 45 degrees. Use a protractor or angle finder to measure the angle accurately.

Sharpen the blades: Use a sharpening stone or diamond file to sharpen the blades of the cuticle nippers. Begin with a coarse grit and move to a finer grit for a smoother finish. Keep the blades at the same angle as the original and make sure to sharpen both blades evenly.

Check the sharpness: Test the sharpness of the blades by cutting a small piece of paper or tissue. If the blades cut smoothly, they're ready to use. If they feel dull, repeat the sharpening process until they're sharp enough for your needs.

Polish the blades: After sharpening and honing the blades of the cuticle nippers, you can use a polishing compound to give them a final polish and restore their shine.

Oil the cuticle nippers: Finally, it's important to oil the cuticle nippers to prevent rust and keep them in good condition. Apply a small amount of oil to the blades and hinges, and wipe away any excess with a soft cloth. Store the cuticle nippers in a dry, cool place until you're ready to use them again.
